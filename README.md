# Learning Projects

A unified repo where I'll store all projects I build while following a book or tutorial.

I used to have a bunch of repos hanging around with the code of different books and tutorials
and they were cluttering my github account. The idea is to have a single place where I can store
all the code that I write while learning different things, knowing where to look for it and 
not interfereing with other public code that I want to show on my repo.

It is also a way to have a learning log where I see all the things I've been working on.
