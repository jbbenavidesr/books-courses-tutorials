# Architecture Patterns With Python

This folder contains my code while following along the book 
[Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/) which 
teaches basics of how to work out an architecture using practices like Test Driven Development (TDD),
Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Event Driven architectures.

Throughout the book, they develop a single application that handles allocation of stock and orders
for an e-commerce.
