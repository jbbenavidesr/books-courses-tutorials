# Python Testing with Pytest

One of the most important skills in order to write clean and scalable code is that of 
testing the code you write. It's so important that it is even recommended to test
the code before even writing it. [This book](https://pragprog.com/titles/bopytest2/python-testing-with-pytest-second-edition/) 
is not on TDD, but testing in general using pytest which is the first step to testing
my python code, understanding the tool.
